would be doing for the day helps immensely. I write my schedule on the night
before the day I am scheduling. It also helps if you have a guy who could
tell you if you are off track. Make this &#39;schedule writing&#39; a part of your
habit, and you won&#39;t be procrastinating to write the schedule. Write it
regularly once or twice and you&#39;re good to go. I recommend writing it on a
small notebook because there are lots of distractions if you write it on
your computer. Unless you don&#39;t want to keep a notebook around/don&#39;t have
one. Just write a schedule and stick with it.Finish all of your work at workAs a student, I don&#39;t like doing homework at home because the opportunity
cost of doing it at home is more significant than doing it at school. That&#39;s
why I do it at school. Then you&#39;ll have more time at home to do whatever you
like.Have self-controlIf you don&#39;t have enough self-control, ask someone to watch over you. ahem

able to do the (2) items listed above.">
