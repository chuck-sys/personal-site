  <p>So here I am again, at the end of the school year. Well, almost the end - I
still have a public exam and still have to grab my report card, but at least all
the classes are over. With the end of the academic year, I can finally focus
full force on a lot more of my side projects, as well as some of my “online”
courses. As of writing, I am currently enrolled in a <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> Android
class. The end of school also means that I could spend time honing my formerly
non-existent chess skills. Mind you, I still need to study for the exam, but
after that, I am/will be in full control for 2 months, right up till school
starts again in September.</p>

<p>A (programming) project that I am currently working on is a <a href="https://github.com/cheukyin699/chip-8-tools">Chip-8
Emulator</a>. I have expanded it to a Chip-8 toolset, and am currently working
on the assembler. (Any feedback or suggestions are welcome.) The going is quite
slow, because of a small amount of <a href="/procrastination/2015/01/19/my-way-of-overcoming-procrastination.html">procrastination</a>. And studying.</p>

<p>As for blog schedules, I plan on posting (at least) once per week, and maybe
even twice per week. Time isn’t an issue, but I don’t know.</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>
