  <blockquote>
  <p>Never left without saying goodbye</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Deemo</strong>, the rhythm-tapping mobile game, with a unorthodox storyline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deemo is a mystic character lives in solitude, a castle, all by itself. A
little girl falls from the sky, not knowing who she is, where she comes from.
To help the little girl back to her world, Deemo comes to realize a tree keeps
growing tall on top of the piano whenever it plays. What would Deemo do when
it gets comfortable with the companionship it never had before? What if the
little girl couldn’t deal with the truth when her seemingly lost memories
regained?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve never played any rhythm games with such a mysterious and different
plot/goal. The free-play version only has limited plot progression, so I got the
full version ($2.48). Here are my thoughts on this, after playing through the
whole game.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>

<p>You just tap the note “bars” when they come. There are 2 types of notes - the
normal black ones and the yellow ones. This gentle learning curve allows you to
start playing songs and pieces without remembering a bunch of different kinds of
notes and how to press them. You just tap the black ones and slide your finger
across the yellow ones (You’ll get it when you <a href="https://www.rayark.com/g/deemo/">get
it</a>). It was easier for me to just start playing
and quickly move on to the harder ones. All songs come in 3 difficulties: Easy,
Normal, and Hard. To make it easier for the user to differentiate, the
developers have quantified the difficulties with different levels (1-10). There
could be an Easy mode marked with lvl 6 difficulty, or a Normal mode marked with
lvl 4 difficulty - a pretty neat feature if I do say so myself.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-resource-consumption">Hardware Resource Consumption</h2>

<p>Not too too bad for a game. Playing one song doesn’t even deplete my Samsung
Core LTE by 1%. For that specific phone, opening it for the first time may cause
lag on the first note, but it’s fine after that.</p>

<h2 id="free-to-play-and-full-version">Free-to-play and Full Version</h2>

<p>The free-to-play only lets you play till you grow the tree to 3.99m tall (just a
<em>little tiny bit</em> from the end of the game at 20m, sarcasm intended). After you
get the tree to 3.99m, the game will urge you to get the full version for $2.48.
If you ignore it, you can still play (with random 50-60s pauses between loading
up a song because you are not using the full version), but you won’t progress at
all. Did I also mention that there is a store that can be unlocked only in the
full version? You start off with only 2 “albums” and you work on unlocking songs
in the albums, but there are more albums, more albums that you have to buy with
real money to play (you can sample them free if you want to). An album costs
more than unlocking the full version itself. A bit outrageous, if you ask me. In
my opinion, I think that they should have removed the “paywalls” and just went
with it. If they needed to, they could just up the price to buy the full
version. I of course didn’t buy more albums; I was content with what I had
already.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you come across this and think that this is just another rhythm game, you are
right - it is just another rhythm game, just branded with another gimmick. The
music is well rounded and (probably) suits everyone, the art style is unique and
simple, and the characters are shrouded in a veil of … mystery. This game is
easy to pick up and easy to put down (unless you are/become an addict). If you
are not a grammar nazi, or if you don’t cringe at the sight of bad translations,
then go ahead, try it out, and see what it will turn you into…</p>
