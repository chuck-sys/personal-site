    <p>If you have arrived at this point, it is assumed that you have slaved through
the parts previous to this one in the series. You may have spent a lot of time -
ranging from a week to half a month - on this (rather large) endeavor. And if
you have made it through, :confetti_ball: <strong>CONGRATULATIONS</strong> :confetti_ball:!
Good work. Now, here is a way to test that your encoder works: by decoding it!</p><h2 id="quick-run-down-of-how-it-works">Quick Run-Down of How it Works</h2><p>Should be rather straightforward:</p><ol><li>Read the binary</li><li>Take up the header information</li><li>Using the header information, (re)construct the Huffman tree</li><li>Using the Huffman tree, construct a map mapping the binary digits to a
character</li><li>Using said map, iterate through the leftover binary data, and write
the characters to stream (whether it be output or file)</li><li>Close the streams</li></ol><p>Because of <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> principles, you
should reuse the code you wrote in your Huffman compression program (in
<code>C/C++</code>'s case, use <code>#include</code> or something - try to avoid copying and
pasting). This goes for (most likely) steps #3-4.</p><h2 id="testing">Testing</h2><p>Should also be quite self-explanatory: you want to see if your Huffman
compressor/decompresser works, you run a plain-text file through the
compressor, producing a binary file. You run said binary file through the
decompresser, producing a plain-text file. You then proceed to check if the
plain-text file you produced is the same with the original file.</p><p><code>valgrind</code> is your friend.</p><h2 id="assignment-for-this-part">Assignment for This Part</h2><ul><li>:star: create Huffman decompresser with code reuse</li><li>:star: finish Huffman compressor/decompresser</li></ul><p>(:star: denotes a challenging task. :star2: denotes an even more challenging
task.)</p><h2 id="final-words">Final Words</h2><p>Wasn't that fun? This project teaches you about the applications of binary
trees, the recursion that comes with it, and a little bit of bit manipulation.</p><p>For some reason, I like it. In fact, I like doing things that involve
(low-level) bit manipulations (like Huffman and <a href="https://github.com/chuck-sys/chip-8-tools">Chip-8 emulators</a>). Ha,
the only thing I seem to dislike about it is when I found out about
endianness - the differences between big and little endian. Some systems (like
mine) used little endian, meaning that some data-types (such as words) are
stored with the least significant byte in the smallest address:</p><pre><code>Original Data: 0xABCDEF

LITTLE ENDIAN
-------------
Address: 0000 | 0001 | 0002
Data:      EF |   CD |   AB

BIG ENDIAN
----------
Address: 0000 | 0001 | 0002
Data:      AB |   CD |   EF
</code></pre><p>Hmmm... this sounds interesting. It is something that I know about, that I have
a little experience in. Looks like an idea for the next tutorial/walkthrough....</p><p>Anyways, I hope you had as much fun making this project as I did! Hopefully,
your teacher would award you properly, or, if not applicable, <em>you</em> would
reward yourself with a nice healthy burst of dopamine. <em>~Niiiiiicce</em>.</p>
