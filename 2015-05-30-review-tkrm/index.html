    <h2 id="warning-the-kite-runner-spoilers-below">WARNING: The Kite Runner SPOILERS BELOW.</h2><p>The Kite Runner movie by Marc Forster, an adaptation to the book with the same
title by Khaled Hosseini, and a feasible alternative to reading the book (or
SparkNotes). With a $20M budget, this film did quite well in the box office, and
got an average of 6.5/10 on RottenTomatoes. So, was this movie a mistake?</p><p>I'm not going to lie, all movies have to cut some scenes out, or else every
movie would be 3-4 hours long. The Kite Runner movie cuts <em><strong>chapters</strong></em> out
from the book. I'm not talking about random short chapters that are scattered
about the book, I'm talking about the whole hospital recovery scenes, for Amir
<em><strong>and</strong></em> Sohrab, and many others. Blatant ignorance of facts from the book is
displayed often, but the thing that gets me is the stoning scene: The man and
woman were supposed to be in dug-out holes, and not made to stand/kneel in front
of the audience; I know that film-producers can't put every single detail in the
movie, but you should at least get the facts right.</p><p>Because the book is a book, it could get away with a lot more violence &amp; gore
than the movie. Why did they make this movie when they knew that they had to cut
back on the "ketchup"? Amir sounded and seemed a lot worse off after his fight
with Assef than in the movie, where he only had to endure a few punches,
upper-cuts, and kicks.</p><p>But maybe this movie wasn't meant to be a movie at all. Maybe we were wrong all
along. Maybe this movie was meant to be a visual guide for the book.</p><p>The movie gives us a pretty accurate visual depiction of Afghanistan pre-war and
post-war, something the book could never give us.  You could actually see the
scenes and change/correct your brain's interpretation of what you've read in the
book. They don't want you to imagine the scenes depicted in the book anymore -
they want you to see it as realistic as they could make it.</p><p>If the movie was made to supplement the book, some of the things they took out
would make sense; the film-makers give you the tools - the characters and the
scenes - and you use your imagination to piece everything together.</p><p>Marc Forster intended for you to watch his film after you've read the book, as
to stimulate your imagination. Just don't think of it as a movie, and you'll be
good to go.</p>
