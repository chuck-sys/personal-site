<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>A few days ago, I was upgrading my Fedora 20 to Fedora 21 as Fedora 20 wasn’t
supported. I finished my upgrade and rebooted my computer. Unfortunately, the
kernel modules failed to load (for some reason or another), and I was stuck on
the GNOME login screen with no mouse and no keyboard. I then opted for a fresh
Fedora 20 install, but I still thought that it was a bit out of date and there
was going to be not much support coming my way if anything went wrong or awry.
That was when I started to think about Linux distribution alternatives that I
could use.</p>

<p>I thought that Arch Linux would be a nice way to learn more about how a normal
Linux distribution configures and installs thing at the command level. I didn’t
think that I would be going with Linux From Scratch, but Arch seemed like the
next best challenge to me. Armed with a notebook and pen, I began scouring the
Internet for information about the whole installation process, which is what I
did for this day, Day 0.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wanted">What I Wanted</h2>

<p>By the end of all this, I wanted to have Arch Linux up and running, dual
booting Windows 10, with the GNOME desktop environment installed and enabled on
start-up.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>I took notes on how to install Arch Linux from the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide">wiki</a>. I also watched
a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFzVG4wZEg">video series</a> on YouTube to double-check, and supplemented my notes
with that as well.</p>

<h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2>

<p>I was not planning to install Arch Linux on my main computer; I was planning on
installing it on my spare laptop to see if anything breaks and not break my
main laptop. Only after I was that confident in my ability to install it I
would actually install it on my main laptop. Needless to say, I got a bit
overzealous after reading the documentation over and over, then finally
understanding what each command does and not blindly following orders like a
, like an, … <em>I don’t know</em>.</p>
