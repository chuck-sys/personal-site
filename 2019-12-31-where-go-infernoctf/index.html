    <p>This was also one of the easier ones. As you can tell, I'm not that good at
these things. I also have never scripted in go before. Here's what happened.</p><p>The program asked for a password, and if the password was correct, we would get
a nice success message. Looking into the program, we see that the input is
checked against an obfuscated string of bytes. The input is run through 2
functions:</p><pre><code class="go">func jai_ram_ji_ki(s string) string {
	chars := []rune(s)
	for i, j := 0, len(words) - 1; i &lt; j; i, j = i + 1, j - 1 {

</code></pre><p>Let's see what would happen if we simply printed the encrypted bytes as a
string:</p><pre><code class="go">fmt.Println(ency)
//!!tA3rG_s1_gn1MMaRg0rP_0g
</code></pre><p>This looks awfully like some kind of flag. Let's see what happens when we
reverse it (using <code>jai_ram_ji_ki</code>):</p><pre><code class="go">fmt.Println(jai_ram_ji_ki(ency))
//g0_Pr0gRaMM1ng_1s_Gr3At!!
</code></pre><p>And whaddyaknow, that's the flag!</p>
