still have a public exam and still have to grab my report card, but at least all

courses. As of writing, I am currently enrolled in a Coursera Android
class. The end of school also means that I could spend time honing my formerly
non-existent chess skills. Mind you, I still need to study for the exam, but
after that, I am/will be in full control for 2 months, right up till school
starts again in September.A (programming) project that I am currently working on is a Chip-8
Emulator. I have expanded it to a Chip-8 toolset, and am currently working
on the assembler. (Any feedback or suggestions are welcome.) The going is quite
slow, because of a small amount of procrastination. And studying.">
