answering for the last 2 hours, "Where's the airplane going and who's inside?"

As he went into another sort-of droney but kind voice to explain where they were
going, he noticed that she asked who was inside, but before he could ponder
more, he blurted, "We're going to Hawaii, for..."

"No, not us! Them!" She pointed out the window. He watched in horror, as another
plane barely missed them.

burrito in front of him. "Almost."
