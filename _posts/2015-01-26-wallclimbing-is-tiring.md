Well, what do you know? **Wallclimbing** is tiring. Our class went wallclimbing today. My fingers were sore and are still sore
from all that gripping. How are those tiny muscles in your fingers supposed to maintain your grip on a round hand-hold? A
major workout for the whole body, I suppose. It was very fun and challenging. This was my first time going up a wall *that*
tall (the ones at the gym don't count), with a guy manning the ropes of course. I should think about taking up wallclimbing as a
hobby.
