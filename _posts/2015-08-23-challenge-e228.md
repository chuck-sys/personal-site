So from here on out, I'm going to try and keep up with [/r/dailyprogrammer][dp]
and do the challenges (, and post solutions and explanations), in order to
document my progress and increase my ability to communicate via writing.

Here is the code I submitted.

~~~ ocaml
open Batteries

let test = ["billowy";
            "biopsy";
            "chinos";
            "defaced";
            "chintz";
            "sponged";
            "bijoux";
            "abhors";
            "fiddle";
            "begins";
            "chimps";
            "wronged"]

let check (str:string) =
    let word = String.to_list str in
    let sorted = List.sort Char.compare word in
    let reved = List.rev word in
    if sorted = word then str ^ " IN ORDER\n" else if sorted = reved then
        str ^ " REVERSED ORDER\n" else str ^ " NOT IN ORDER\n";;

List.map print_string (List.map check test)
~~~

The logic behind it is: there is a function `check` that checks if a word is in
order or not (or reversed). It sorts the word (by character) and makes a reverse
copy of it, then compares them. Note that `=` was used instead of `==`. Then I
mapped it through the list, and printed them out one by one. The difficulty here
for me was to convert a `string` into a `char list`, which wasn't support in
core OCaml (which confuses me, because the majority of other languages support
this).

After a bit of googling, I found that the `Batteries` library has that function,
so off I went!
