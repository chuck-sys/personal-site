For this day, I didn't read up on any tutorials or guides. I just followed the
instructions from this video: [From Post Install to Xorg][xorgvid]. As a
result, the rest of this post will mostly be me trying to transcribe the video
into written (typed) words.

## Software Installations

To enable 64-bit libraries, I edited `/etc/pacman.conf` and uncommented the
lines that were about **multilib**. To update the system, use `pacman -Syu`.

To install the 64-bit development libraries, I did:

```sh
sudo pacman -S multilib-devel fakeroot git wget jshon make pkg-config \
autoconf automake patch
```


### Unmuting ALSA

```sh
sudo pacman -S alsa-utils
alsamixer           # Unmute ALSA channels
speaker-test -c 2   # Test sound (2 speakers)
```


### Installing Xorg Base Packages

```sh
sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit xorg-server-utils mesa
sudo pacman -S xf86-video-vesa   # Video driver fall-back
```


### Testing if Xorg works

```sh
sudo pacman -S xorg-twm xorg-xclock xterm
startx
```

A few terminals opened up, so that I knew that xorg was good.


### Installing GNOME

```sh
sudo pacman -S gnome gnome-extra
sudo systemctl enable gdm.service
```

After this, I rebooted, and *voila*, one GNOME login screen was presented. I
logged in, and everything was fine, so I began to personalize my setup.
