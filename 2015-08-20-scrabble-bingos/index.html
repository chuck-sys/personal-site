    <p>The easier way to create bingos is to save a prefix/suffix and wait until you
could append/prepend it to a word. As you can see, blank tiles are immensely
useful. Say you are currently saving <code>ING</code>. This makes it so that you only need
to make a 4-letter word with the rest of your tiles instead of a 7 letter word.
Common beginnings/endings that are easy to make words with are:</p><pre><code>-ING
-ERS
-IER
DE-
RE-
</code></pre><p>The most common one that you would actually run into is <code>-ERS</code>. You can see why
it is so useful: If you can't place it on the board, simply rearrange the <code>ER</code>
to the <code>RE-</code>. There are, of course, times where you should save your letters,
and times where it simply isn't worth your trouble. If you have a balanced
rack, you should probably save them. If you have an imbalanced rack, well,
just use up as many tiles as you can and don't try to save them.</p><p>Experts don't do just that - they sort their tiles in alphabetical order, then,
they cross reference that with all 7-letter words (that were also sorted in
alphabetical order). I honestly don't have that much time for memorizing them,
so I do this instead.</p>
