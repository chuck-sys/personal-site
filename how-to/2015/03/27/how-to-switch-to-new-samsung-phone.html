    <p>Download Samsung Smart Switch Mobile<br /> This also works for any android
phone/IOS phone switching to Samsung phone. Download this app for both
devices. For both phones, press “Android to Galaxy”, and hold them close
together. For the old phone, check the items that you want to send, then
press “Transfer”. If that doesn’t transfer, use the “Connect device manually”
option in the menu. This should take a relatively short amount of time.</p>
