Well, what do you know? **Wallclimbing** is tiring. Our class went wallclimbing
today. My fingers were sore and are still sore from all that gripping. How are
those tiny muscles in your fingers supposed to maintain your grip on a round
hand-hold? A major workout for the whole body, I suppose. It was very fun and
challenging. This was my first time going up a wall *that* tall (the ones at the
gym don't count), with a guy manning the ropes of course. I should think about
taking up wallclimbing as a hobby.
