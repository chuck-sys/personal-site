The waiter put down his sandwich. The customer prodded it with a fork. "It's
bloody cold! You make me wait here for a full hour and I get it cold?!" And the
waiter was apologizing - you could almost see him kneeling on the ground. "I'm
sorry. So sorry sir...." And he was using the situation towards his advantage.
"I have had enough of your shenanigans! Don't expect me to give this place even
an inkling of a positive review!" And with that crude remark, he marched out of
his seat and slammed the door with the finality of a gavel. The waiter's faint
protest dimmed to a murmur: "But I thought you said you wanted cold cuts...."
