This one was one of the easier ones. We are given some `.txt` files, `.csv`
files, and a single `.h` C header file. We see that the `.csv` files contain
keylogging data, where the first column is a timestamp and the second column is
the key that was pressed. From these `.csv` files, we are supposed to figure
out what Santa typed.

The `.csv` files correspond to the `.txt` files (e.g. `sms1.csv` corresponds to
`sms1.txt`), and we are supposed to decode `sms4.csv`. Though we are not
completely sure what the function keys correspond to (i.e. `MENU_LEFT`,
`MENU_RIGHT`, `MENU_UP`, `MENU_DOWN`), we can still try to decode the file. And
so we write the following Python code:

```python
import sys

KS = {
    0: " 0",
    1: ".,'?!\"1-()@/:",
    2: "abc2",
    3: "def3",
    4: "ghi4",
    5: "jkl5",
    6: "mno6",
    7: "pqrs7",
    8: "tuv8",
    9: "wxyz9",
    10: "@/:_;+&%*[]{}",
    11: ['T9', 'T9_CAPS', 'ABC', 'ABC_CAPS'],
    100: ['LEFT' * i for i in range(1, 20)],
    101: ['RIGHT' * i for i in range(1, 20)],
    102: ['UP' * i for i in range(1, 20)],
    103: ['DOWN' * i for i in range(1, 20)],
    104: ['CALL_ACCEPT' * i for i in range(1, 20)],
    105: ['CALL_REJECT' * i for i in range(1, 20)]
}

strokes = []

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f:
    strokes = list(map(lambda s: (int(s.split(',')[0]), int(s.split(',')[1])),
                       f.readlines()))

def process(key, times):
    global KS
    return KS[key][(times - 1) % len(KS[key])]

last_ts, last_key = strokes[0]
repeat = 1
for ts, key in strokes[1:]:
    if last_key != key:
        # The keys changed; output
        print(process(last_key, repeat), end='')
        repeat = 1
        last_ts = ts
        last_key = key
    elif last_key == key:
        # The same key
        repeat += 1
        last_ts = ts
    else:
        # W
        print(f'\nWATT (ts={ts}, key={key})\n')
```

In essence, we look up a character based on the number of times we see it
repeated. Let's try running it:

```console
$ python analyze.py sms1.csv
LEFTLEFTLEFTLEFTT9_CAPSrudolf where are you bsLEFTLEFT0m, .l ,p

$ cat sms1.txt
date: 1999-11-23 03:01:10
to: 00611015550117
text: rudolf where are you brrr
```

If you recall, we were also given the timestamps of each keystroke. Remember
that if you pressed a key and waited long enough, the key would be printed and
you could press another key (even if it is the same key). So we add this delay
into play:

```python
# ...
TS_DELTA = 900
# ...
elif last_key == key and ts - last_ts <= TS_DELTA:
	# ...
elif last_key == key and ts - last_ts >= TS_DELTA:
	# The same key but more time has passed
	print(process(last_key, repeat), end='')
	repeat = 1
	last_ts = ts
# ...
```

We set a constant `TS_DELTA` as a threshold, equal to 900 ms. We run the
program again and see the results:

```console
$ python analyze.py sms1.csv
LEFTLEFTLEFTLEFTT9_CAPSrudolf where are you brrrLEFTLEFT0m, .l ,p
```

Let's see if we can do the same with `sms4.csv`:

```console
$ # Line-breaks for your sanity
$ python analyze.py sms4.csv
LEFTLEFTLEFTLEFTT9_CAPSalright pal hersUPeDOWN ye flag good lucj enterUPUPUPUPUPUPUPDOWNRIGHTk
DOWNDOWNDOWNDOWNDOWNDOWNing it with those hooves lol its
aotw{l3ts_dr1nk_s0m3_eggnogRIGHTRIGHT0g_y0u_cr4zy_d33r}LEFTLEFT0m.. .l ,p
```

We seem to be very close to the answer. We see that the flag is split up by two
`RIGHT`s. The characters at the left and the right of the delimiter are similar
to each other. From this, we deduce that the `MENU_RIGHT` button acts as a
backspace. We make these alterations to the code:

```python
# ...
KS = {
	# ...
	101: ['\b' * i for i in range(1, 20)],
	# ...
}
# ...
```

`\b` is an escape sequence that brings the pointer backwards by 1 character.

```console
$ # Line breaks for your sanity
$ python analyze.py sms4.csv
LEFTLEFTLEFTLEFTT9_CAPSalright pal hersUPeDOWN ye flag good lucj
enterUPUPUPUPUPUPUPDOWkDOWNDOWNDOWNDOWNDOWNDOWNing it with those hooves lol its
aotw{l3ts_dr1nk_s0m3_eggn0g_y0u_cr4zy_d33r}LEFTLEFT0m.. .l ,p
```

Also you can see that the `MENU_UP` and `MENU_DOWN` both correspond to moving
the pointer to the left and to the right, but since it doesn't concern the
flag, we don't need to worry about them. It is left as an exercise to the
reader to modify the above code so that it takes `MENU_UP` and `MENU_DOWN` into
account.
