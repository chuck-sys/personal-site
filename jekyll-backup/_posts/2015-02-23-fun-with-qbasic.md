So I had a rough day with windows (I can no longer use it without safe mode,
would fix later), so I wanted to have some fun, so I went with a qbasic tutorial
and made this colorful thing:

***Ah, how I just love vim's `gU`...***

But I'm getting sidetracked right now. What we have now is an
epilepsy-enducing program that gets terminated only if you press any key.
