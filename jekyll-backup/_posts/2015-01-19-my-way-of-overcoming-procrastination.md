__Procrastination__ has become a huge problem in my (high) school career, and
probably will be.  From school projects to homework assignments to studying for
tests, I always had been avoiding it until the very last minutes. I don't know
about you guys, but here are some methods I use to combat procrastination:

1. __Make a Day Schedule__

    I know this sounds really cheesy, but it works. Having a plan of what you
    would be doing for the day helps immensely. I write my schedule on the night
    before the day I am scheduling. It also helps if you have a guy who could
    tell you if you are off track. Make this 'schedule writing' a part of your
    habit, and you won't be procrastinating to write the schedule. Write it
    regularly once or twice and you're good to go. I recommend writing it on a
    small notebook because there are lots of distractions if you write it on
    your computer. Unless you don't want to keep a notebook around/don't have
    one. Just write a schedule and ___stick with it___.

2. __Finish all of your work at work__

    As a student, I don't like doing homework at home because the opportunity
    cost of doing it at home is more significant than doing it at school. That's
    why I do it at school. Then you'll have more time at home to do whatever you
    like.

3. __Have self-control__

    If you don't have enough self-control, ask someone to watch over you. _ahem_
    Family & friends _ahem_. Without sufficient self-control, you may not be
    able to do the (2) items listed above.
