Welcome Back
------------

Last time, we finished the basic skeleton, and now it is time to implement some
functions! Let's do some easy ones first.

The Buffer Class
----------------

Create a file `Buffer.cpp`. This all should be fairly straightforward and easy
to understand. We'll set up first.

``` cpp
#include "Buffer.h"

Buffer::Buffer() {}
```

Let's have fun with recursion now, and do the `remTabs(string)` function!

``` cpp
string Buffer::remTabs(string line)
{
    int tab = line.find("\t");
    if(tab == line.npos)
        return line;
    else
        return remTabs(line.replace(tab, 1, "    "));
}
```

Keep in mind that there are 4 spaces in the string. This function recursively
finds a tab in a line. When a tab is found, it goes again until no more tabs
could be found, then returns the line.

Now for some helper functions for line operations. These are not really
necessary but are asthetically pleasing should you use them in your `Editor.cpp`
file (which you will). It makes your code there more readable (I think).

``` cpp
void Buffer::insertLine(string line, int n)
{
    line = remTabs(line);                   // Conversion (happens every time)
    lines.insert(lines.begin()+n, line);
}

void Buffer::appendLine(string line)
{
    line = remTabs(line);
    lines.push_back(line);
}

void Buffer::removeLine(int n)
{
    lines.erase(lines.begin()+n);
}
```


An Abrupt End
-------------

And that's it till next time! You are ready for Part 3!
