1. Download Samsung Smart Switch Mobile<br> This also works for any android
   phone/IOS phone switching to Samsung phone. Download this app for both
   devices. For both phones, press "Android to Galaxy", and hold them close
   together. For the old phone, check the items that you want to send, then
   press "Transfer". If that doesn't transfer, use the "Connect device manually"
   option in the menu. This should take a relatively short amount of time.

2. Switch (micro)SD cards<br> Well, duh...
