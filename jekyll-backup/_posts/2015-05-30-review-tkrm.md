## WARNING: The Kite Runner SPOILERS BELOW.

The Kite Runner movie by Marc Forster, an adaptation to the book with the same
title by Khaled Hosseini, and a feasible alternative to reading the book (or
SparkNotes). With a $20M budget, this film did quite well in the box office, and
got an average of 6.5/10 on RottenTomatoes. So, was this movie a mistake?

I'm not going to lie, all movies have to cut some scenes out, or else every
movie would be 3-4 hours long. The Kite Runner movie cuts ___chapters___ out
from the book. I'm not talking about random short chapters that are scattered
about the book, I'm talking about the whole hospital recovery scenes, for Amir
___and___ Sohrab, and many others. Blatant ignorance of facts from the book is
displayed often, but the thing that gets me is the stoning scene: The man and
woman were supposed to be in dug-out holes, and not made to stand/kneel in front
of the audience; I know that film-producers can't put every single detail in the
movie, but you should at least get the facts right.

Because the book is a book, it could get away with a lot more violence & gore
than the movie. Why did they make this movie when they knew that they had to cut
back on the "ketchup"? Amir sounded and seemed a lot worse off after his fight
with Assef than in the movie, where he only had to endure a few punches,
upper-cuts, and kicks.

But maybe this movie wasn't meant to be a movie at all. Maybe we were wrong all
along. Maybe this movie was meant to be a visual guide for the book.

The movie gives us a pretty accurate visual depiction of Afghanistan pre-war and
post-war, something the book could never give us.  You could actually see the
scenes and change/correct your brain's interpretation of what you've read in the
book. They don't want you to imagine the scenes depicted in the book anymore -
they want you to see it as realistic as they could make it.

If the movie was made to supplement the book, some of the things they took out
would make sense; the film-makers give you the tools - the characters and the
scenes - and you use your imagination to piece everything together.

Marc Forster intended for you to watch his film after you've read the book, as
to stimulate your imagination. Just don't think of it as a movie, and you'll be
good to go.
